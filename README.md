Display utilization of various buildings as a percentage for the last one minute.
100% utilization means the factory was working in every single tick in the last 60 seconds.

The percentage is displayed at the top left corner of the building. I used "flying-text" for the percentages for simplicity, which means the percentages have a fixed size regardless of the zoom level. It is useful to overview the whole base.

Sorry for the crap quality screenshots but my laptop can only run Factorio with low graphics settings.
